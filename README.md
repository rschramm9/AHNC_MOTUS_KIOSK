# AHNC_MOTUS_KIOSK
## Ankeny Hill Nature Center MOTUS Kiosk System

This project creates a public display or "kiosk"" for a Motus receiver station for the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Ankeny Hill Nature Center.  The goal is to engage public visitors to the site with a simple near-realtime display of migratory bird tag detection events. It presents a very simple limited number of screens that are easy to navigate via a touchscreen display.

The Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus) is an international collaborative research network that uses coordinated automated radio telemetry to facilitate research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. Motus is a program of Birds Canada in partnership with collaborating researchers and organizations. Learn more at https://motus.org
