# AHNC_MOTUS_KIOSK
## Ankeny Hill Nature Center MOTUS Kiosk System

This project creates a public display or "kiosk"" for a Motus receiver station for the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Ankeny Hill Nature Center.  The goal is to engage public visitors to the site with a simple near-realtime display of migratory bird tag detection events. It presents a very simple limited number of screens that are easy to navigate via a touchscreen display.

The Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus) is an international collaborative research network that uses coordinated automated radio telemetry to facilitate research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. Motus is a program of Birds Canada in partnership with collaborating researchers and organizations. Learn more at https://motus.org

### Hardware & Software Requirements

I have quite successfully run on low-end  Intel NUC PC computers with Window 10 Pro pre-installed. These are easily purchased used on eBay for as little as $100. 

NUC6CAY Celeron J3455 Processor 1.5Ghz 8GB Ram 120GB SSD w/wifi and Windows10 Pro (eBay $100)

NUC7i5BNH MiniPC QUadCore i5-78260U 8Gb w/128Gb SSD w/wifi and  Windows 10 Pro. (eBay $185)

As an experiment: CHUWI Larkbox PRO miniPC 6GbRam QuadCore 2.7Ghz Celeron J4125 with wifi and Windows 10 (Home Ed) $139 Amazon --not recommended due to reliablity concerns, but its cute!)

The touchscreen: Dell 24 Touchscreen Model P2418HT (Dell.com $350)

USB Keyboard and Mouse

I *strongly* recommend Windows-10 PRO edition.  Home Edition works too but with some headaches.

### Where to Start?

See **WINDOWS_FIRSTRUN_README.md** in the project's top level directory. 

Alternately, if you want to skip all of the Windows and kiosk-specific setup and just play with the app in R, see BUILDING_THE_APP_README.md
