 The semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) is a small plover. 
 This species weighs 22–63 g (0.78–2.22 oz) and measures 14–20 cm (5.5–7.9 in) in 
 length and 35–56 cm (14–22 in) across the wings.[3] Adults have a grey-brown back and wings,
 a white belly, and a white breast with one black neckband.
 They have a brown cap, a white forehead,
 a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill.
 </p><p> 
 They are migratory and winter in coastal areas of the southern United States, 
 the Caribbean and much of South America. They are extremely rare vagrants to 
 western Europe, and have been found in Tierra del Fuego and the Isles of Scilly.
  Their true status may be obscured by the difficulty
 in identifying them from the very similar ringed plover of Eurasia, 
 of which it was formerly considered a subspecies.
 </p><p>
 This bird resembles the killdeer but is much smaller and has only one band.
 Since the semipalmated plover nests on the ground, 
 it uses a "broken-wing" display to lure intruders away from the nest, 
 in a display similar to the related killdeer.
