The sanderling is a small plump sandpiper, 18–20 cm (7.1–7.9 in) in length. 
Its weight ranges from 40–100 g (1.4–3.5 oz). The winter bird is very pale,
 almost white apart from a dark shoulder patch. This is the source of the specific
  name, alba, which is the Latin for "white". Later in the summer,
   the face and throat become brick-red.
 The juvenile bird is spangled black and white, 
 and shows much more contrast than the adult.

 The sanderling breeds in the High Arctic areas of North America, Europe and Asia.
  In North America, it breeds in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Nunavut, Greenland 
  (and to a lesser extent Alaska). In Eurasia, it breeds in Spitsbergen and areas 
  of northern Russia from the Taymyr Peninsula to the New Siberian Islands.
 </p><p> 
 It is a complete migrant, travelling between 3,000 to 10,000 km
  (1,900 to 6,200 mi) from its breeding grounds to its wintering sites.
   
   Most adults leave the breeding grounds in July and early August, 
   whereas juvenile birds leave in late August and early September. 
   The northward migration begins in March at the southern end of their
    winter distribution.

  
  During the winter and its migration, it is most commonly found on coastal sandy beaches,
   but also occurs on tidal sand flats, mud flats and the shores of lakes and rivers.
