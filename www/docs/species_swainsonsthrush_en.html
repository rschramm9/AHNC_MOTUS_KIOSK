Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), also called olive-backed thrush and
russet-backed thrush, is a medium-sized thrush. It is a member of genus Catharus
and is typical of it in terms of its subdued coloration and beautiful,
ascending flute-like voice. 
</p>
<p>
The breeding habitat of Swainson's thrush is coniferous woods with dense undergrowth across
Canada, Alaska, and the northern United States; also, deciduous wooded areas on
the Pacific coast of North America.
</p><p>
These birds migrate to southern Mexico and as far south as Argentina. The coastal subspecies
migrate down the Pacific coast of North America and winter from Mexico to Costa Rica,
whereas the continental birds migrate eastwards within North America (a substantial detour)
and then travel southwards via Florida to winter from Panama to Bolivia.
