The dunlin (Calidris alpina) is a small wader, formerly sometimes separated with the other "stints" in
the genus Erolia. The English name is a dialect form of "dunling", first recorded in 1531–1532. It derives
 from dun, "dull brown", with the suffix -ling, meaning a person or thing with the given quality.[2]
</p>
<p>It is a circumpolar breeder in Arctic or subarctic regions. Birds that breed in northern Europe and Asia
 are long-distance migrants, wintering south to Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East. Birds that 
 breed in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic migrate short distances to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts 
 of North America, although those nesting in northern Alaska overwinter in Asia. 
 Many dunlins winter along the Iberian south coast.
