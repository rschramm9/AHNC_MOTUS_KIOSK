<div id="what-is-this" class="section level3">

<p>This is the terminal for the Ankeny Hill Nature Center's Motus receiver. This system
uses the antennas you can see outside of this building to listen for messages from
special radio tags that have been attached to birds by researchers anywhere in the world.
When a bird with a Motus tag flies into the range of our receiver it's signal is
decoded and information specific to that individual is displayed here. 
Under ideal conditions tags can be detected up to 15 miles away.
To be detected the tag must be in line-of-sight of the antenna. Birds on the ground or
blocked by trees and hills may not be seen by the receiver until they take flight.

research network that uses coordinated automated radio telemetry to facilitate research and
education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals."</i><br>- motus.org
