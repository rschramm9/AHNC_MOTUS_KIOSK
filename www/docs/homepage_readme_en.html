<div id="what-is-this" class="section level3">
  
<p>This is the terminal for the Ankeny Hill Nature Center's Motus receiver. This system
uses the antennas like those can see outside of this building to listen for messages from
special radio tags that have been attached to wildlife by researchers all over the world.
Different size tags can be attached to birds, bats or even insects.
When a animal with a Motus tag flies into the range of our receiver it's signal is
decoded and information specific to that individual is displayed here. 
Under ideal conditions tags can be detected up to 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) away.
To be detected the tag must be in line-of-sight of the antenna. Birds on the ground or
blocked by trees and hills may not be seen by the receiver until they take flight.
