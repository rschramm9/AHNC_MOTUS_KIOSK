The Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is a small shorebird. 

This is one of the most abundant shorebird species in North America, 
with a population in the millions.
</p>
<p>
Adults have dark legs and a short, thin, dark bill, thinner at the tip.

The body is brown on top and white underneath. They are reddish-brown on the crown.
This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds,
especially the semipalmated sandpiper. This is particularly the case in winter plumage, 
when both species are plain gray.
The western sandpiper acquires winter plumage much earlier in the autumn than
the semipalmated
sandpiper.
 </p>
 <p>
Their breeding habitat is tundra in eastern Siberia and Alaska.
They nest on the ground usually under some vegetation. The male makes several scrapes;
the female selects one and lays 4 eggs. Both parents incubate and care for 
dependent young, who feed themselves. Sometimes the female deserts her mate 
and brood prior to offspring fledging.
